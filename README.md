Techdegree-Project-5
In this project, JavaScript is used to get 12 random 'employees' from the Random User Generator API.
Then, the employees are dynamically added to the page along with a search bar, to filter employees by name. When an employee is clicked, a modal pops up displaying their information. The modal has buttons to cycle between the next and previous employee.
"Raleway" font from Google Fonts was added. When a card is hovered, it will grow in size and the color of the employee name changes to blue.
